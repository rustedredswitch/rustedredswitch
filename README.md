# Hi, I'm Alessandro 👨🏻‍💻

I am a junior back-end Software Engineer currently working at Intré. My primary programming language is Java, and I specialize in working with the Spring Boot framework. I am also enthusiastic about broadening my skillset, and I am currently studying front-end development using Typescript and Angular. I have a keen interest in Agile methodologies and Scrum practices, as I strongly believe in their ability to enhance productivity and teamwork.
