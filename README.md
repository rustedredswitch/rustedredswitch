<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Alessandro 👨🏻‍💻</h1>

I am a junior back-end Software Engineer currently working at Intré. My primary programming language is **Java**, and I specialize in working with the **Spring Boot** framework. I am also enthusiastic about broadening my skillset, and I am currently studying front-end development using Typescript and Angular. I have a keen interest in **Agile methodologies and Scrum practices**, as I strongly believe in their ability to enhance productivity and teamwork.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my English Cocker Spaniel and going on long walks or doing scent activities with him. 🐾
